Problem_1
-----------
1. The code defines a class named `calculator` to perform basic arithmetic operations.
2. The constructor `__init__` initializes two numbers and the operation type.
3. It stores the inputs as instance variables for later use.
4. The `calculate` method checks which operation to perform using `match-case`.
5. It supports four operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
6. The operation input is converted to lowercase to avoid case mismatches.
7. If an unknown operation is entered, it returns an error message.
8. The program asks the user to input two numbers and the operation type.
9. It creates an object of the calculator class using the given inputs.
10. Finally, it calls the `calculate` method and prints the result.

Problem_2
----------
 1. A function is defined to generate a list of odd numbers.
2. It takes one input value, which determines how many odd numbers should be considered.
3. An empty list is created to store the odd numbers.
4. A loop runs from 0 up to twice the input value plus one.
5. Within the loop, each number is checked to see if it is odd using the modulus operator.
6. If the number is odd, it is added to the list.
7. After the loop ends, the list of odd numbers is returned.
8. The user is asked to enter a number.
9. The function is called with the userâ€™s input.
10. The final result - the list of odd numbers - is printed.
